# yolo_py3.5_tf1.0
Forked from [nilboy](https://github.com/nilboy/tensorflow-yolo).
As Tensorflow 1.0 has discarded some old functions, so I updated those functions(in `./yolo/net` folder). I have tested this code with VOC2007 dataset and [ECUSTFD](https://github.com/Liang-yc/ECUSTFD-resized-) in Python 3.5.2 with tensorflow 1.0.<br>
Before using it ,you need to download the [pretrain file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yiAeTLLamRekxqVE01Yi1RRlk/view?usp=sharing).
If you can not visit Google, try [BaiduYun](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1dEHjlJz). After downloading it, you should move the downloaded `.ckpt` file into `./models/pretrain/` folder. And do not forget to download your dataset.
